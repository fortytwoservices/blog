To show our dedication to open source, security and community, we are thrilled to announce that we are now official members of The Linux Foundation (LF), Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). As a company that builds cloud native and security services based on Open Source, it is only natural for us to help sponsor the many projects that these fine foundations support.

As active contributors in these communities, we always strived to do more, and joining OpenSSF and CNCF is a significant step forward in our efforts. With this move, we aim to strengthen our commitment to supporting the Open Source community, promoting innovation, and driving adoption of cloud-native technologies.

We are proud to be part of the Linux Foundation, and we look forward to working with the OpenSSF and CNCF communities to advance the industry and create lasting value for our customers.

## Not only members, but also active contributors

While being a member helps the foundations, we are also active contributors to various projects and working groups.

We have been active in the CNCF for several years now. We are contributing primarily to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for App Delivery, which hosts projects and working groups that are more catered to the application operations. We have been supporting the Platforms Working Group, and the OpenGitOps project in particular.

Our involvement in the OpenSSF has not completely solidified yet, as we have recently started to find our bearings. So far, we have prioritized the End Users and Best Practices Working Groups. There are so many great working groups and projects happening in the OpenSSF, so we are very exciting to get even more involved here.
